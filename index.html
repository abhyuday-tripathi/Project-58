			Everybody have hobbies.<br>
			My hobby is progamming.Hobbies are a great way to relax and unwind.But hobbies like coding requires high skills.This year,all thanks to Whitehat Jr.,I found my hobby.During the early stage of pandamic when the lockdown was declared,I was somewhat excited.I thought I would finally get rid of school,but after a mere time of 20 days I got restless.I was bored to death. One day my mom told me about some computer programming and coding course. It caught my attention because of two reasons:- 1. I was very much interested in computer and 2. I had nothing to do. Of course,this started off as a timepass and "doing something fruitful" which would help me in future. But as a I got to learn more about it, the more interested I got. Now, not only I wait for my coding classes, I also started doing ventures of my own. I love doing coding now.
